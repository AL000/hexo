<h3>Watch for File Changes</h3>
<p>Hexo can watch for file changes and regenerate files immediately. </p>
<figure class="highlight lang-bash"><pre>$ hexo generate --watch
</pre></figure>

<blockquote class="note info"><strong class="note-title">Restart Hexo after configuration changed</strong><p>Hexo doesn&#39;t watch for configuration file changes. You have to restart Hexo to make the new configurations take effects.</p>

<h3>Multi-thread Generating</h3>
<p>Hexo supports multi-thread generating since 2.0. To enable this feature, edit <code>_config.yml</code>.</p>
<figure class="highlight lang-yaml"><pre><span class="attribute">multi_thread</span>: <span class="string">true</span>
</pre></figure>

<p>You can change how many threads to use. Just edit <code>multi_thread</code> with the number of threads. The number of threads is the number of CPU cores by default. It&#39;s not recommended to set any value higher than it.</p>
<h3>Deploy After Generating</h3>
<p>To deploy after generating, you can run one of the following commands. Both of them are equaled.</p>
<figure class="highlight lang-bash"><pre>$ hexo generate --deploy
$ hexo deploy --generate
</pre></figure>
